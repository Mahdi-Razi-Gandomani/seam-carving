# Seam Carving — Content-Aware Image Resizing

## Overview
This project implements **content-aware image resizing** using **seam carving**, a technique that intelligently removes pixels from an image while preserving its most important visual content.  

Two methods are used for finding seams:
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** — a graph-based approach using shortest path computation.  
- **Dynamic Programming** — an optimized method that reduces computation time.

## Usage

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahdi-razi-gandomani/seam-carving.git
cd seam-carving
```

### Running the Program
You can run the seam carving tool directly from the command line:

```bash
python3 main.py data/input2.jpg data/output2.jpg --vertical 50 --horizontal 30 --method dp --gif
```

## How It Works

### What Is Seam Carving?
Seam carving is a **content-aware image resizing** algorithm that removes (or inserts) seams — connected paths of least “energy” pixels — from an image.  
Instead of cropping edges or uniformly scaling, it preserves the most visually important regions.

### Energy Function
The **energy function** estimates the “importance” of each pixel based on local gradients:

$$
E(x, y) = \sqrt{(dR_x^2 + dG_x^2 + dB_x^2) + (dR_y^2 + dG_y^2 + dB_y^2)}
$$

High energy = significant detail (edges, objects)  
Low energy = background or uniform areas



### Finding Seams via Dijkstra’s Algorithm
1. Model the image as a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**:
   - Pixels → vertices  
   - Energy values → edge weights  
   - Adjacent pixels → directed edges
2. Use **Dijkstra’s algorithm** to find the lowest-energy path (shortest path).
3. Remove that path (seam) from the image.

### Dynamic Programming Alternative
The DP method computes minimum-energy paths more efficiently by reusing results from previous columns/rows, achieving better runtime with less memory overhead.
